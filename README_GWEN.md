# Personnal notes

This file will be used to take some notes during the project
I'll clean it and add my tought on the project at the end
## First setup

I installed and init express / sqlite / typescript / jest with default settings before pushing the first commit
I also added some utils ( nodemon ) for easier dev time and set up all my npm commands
And to finish up; added the minimal to get the server up and running, as well as a dummy test to check if jest is working as intended
